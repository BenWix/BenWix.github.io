   When working on projects I have often been derailed by various distractions that are always so tempting. There are always different things that are so tempting and can pull me away from the functionality of my site. In my Sinatra Project, I was most of the way through getting the functionality completed when I decide to spend some time on styling and that takes half a day away while I try to figure out how to get one thing just right. In my rails project I want to add more third party authentication "Just Because" but there is still some basic functionality I have not polished yet. I add more new features while I still have bugs in the old one. It seems that is always easier to start another goal than to get the one I am working on just right. 
   While Working on my Rails Project I was able to figure out a few techniques to help keep me focused on the right area of my project and moving in the right direction. I think the first and most important step is figuring out what you want your project to be. Starting a project without a defined list of your project requirements is like going to the grocery store hungry without a shopping list. You will probably end up with things you don't need, and not what you came for. Taking several hours to define a project and put pen to paper can save you hours on the back end. A few techniques to use here are writing out stories i.e.

"As a guest, I want to be able to signup so that I can join the community"
"As a user, I want to be able to edit my posts so I can improve them as I learn more."
"As a user, I want suggestions I what to read next so I can find new art."

   Stories define the user, what they want, and why they want them. Stories could also be compared to something called "Customer Requirements" and then these can be translated into "Engineering Requirements". Usually a customer requirement is a qualiatative description, and then the engineering team has to make a quantatative goal to relate to that. For example, if a company is making a new car, the customer might say, "I want it to be fast". Now fast is a relative term so how will the engineers know if they are successful? Well if they say the engineering requirement is "The car should be able to accelerate from 0-60 is 7 seconds." That is a very easy thing to measure to see if the team is successful. So now that you have definable goals for success that you have made from your customer requirements or stories, what do we do. I have found that several levels of functionality help organize productivity. 

	For my rails project, I wrote out severak stories and then organized those into several different levels that I wanted to reach. The first level was basic functionality, and what I needed to pass the project requirements at flatiron. After that I added some of the more in depth features to make the site more than just a simple CRUD model. The third level starts to add things that I think would make the site much more functional, but I don't exactly know how I would achieve these requirements yet. And the fourth level is everything I can think of along with deploying the site. You can see this defined below!

	Trello is a great tool to keep track of progress and see what still needs to be done. I can have lists for each of my levels and different checklists for each requirement in a level. This can help me know what to work on less and make sure I don't get pulled off track by all of the tantilizing fun things I could add along the way
