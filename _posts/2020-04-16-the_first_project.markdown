    Starting work on the first Flatiron Project was an incredibly exciting and slightly nerve wracking time. I was bouncing around in my head, making sure I knew everything I needed to accomplish the project. I was working to push hard throught the curriculum to get to the project on time or early. I wanted to make sure I was set up for success. 
		
		Thankfully, I was able to get to the project a little early and could put in some good work the weekend before project week, this started to bolster my confidence a little bit. The more time I had, the more likely I would be to succeed. When I dove into the project I wanted to make sure that it would not only make a good project to demonstrate my skills, but that it would also push me in some of the areas that I was weak. Every opporunity, can be an opportunity to turn a weakness into a strength. I identified my weakness before I dove in, so I knew I needed to find a project that would utilize gems more heavily. I found an API that was about rock climbing routes (climbing is my all time favorite activity), so I figured this could be a great fit for me. Looking at the big hurdles I would face in the project, I initially identified three.

1. To access the API, I would need to get that latitude and longitude of a location.
2. To get the latitude and longitude, I would need to use a gem I hadn't used before. Geocode.
3. The API required a private key, so I would need to learn how to make a .env and .gitignore file

   This tasks felt daunting in the moment, but knowing that they would start to round me out as a better overall programmer, I was excited to take on the task. I was pleasently surprised with how smoothly some of these steps went. It only took me one afternoon to decipher the geocode gem and get it working with the API. It took a bit more head scratching and google searching to get the .gitignore and .env file to function, but now that I have done it once, I will be totally prepared to do it next time. 
	 
   The rest of the project build process was a very fun challenge, that got me excited to see what I will build next. Little puzzles that I needed to solve kept the build fun and spicy. I am relatively happy with how I solves all of the problems, but I am excited to see the new ways I will learn to tackle these things in the future.
	 
	 That's one project down, and many more to go. And I couldn't be more excited about that.
