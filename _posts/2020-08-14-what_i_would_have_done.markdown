As I sit here, just having 'finished' my final project at flatiron (I put finished in quotes, because I will undoubtedly keep working on this project for a while), I can't help but look back and think about what I would have done different knowing what I know now. 

I knew going in, that this was such a rare opportunity to have several months, almost completely dedicated to learning, self development, and growth. As someone who can never learn enough, and loves a good challenge, I could not be more excited. I greeted most days with a healthy amount of excitment and eagerness. I wanted to sieze this day and I wanted to have fun doing it. There is nothing that matches the satisfaction of having a new concept fit in. It was almost like I was addicted to this learning fix, and needed it as soon as possible. It was a hard realization to come to, that even in this dedicated learning environment, I wouldn't get it everyday. There were days I finished more confused than when I started, and there are days when I hardly accomplished anything at all. It took some time for me to accept that this was ok. Smooth seas don't make good sailors. Learning that plans don't always go your way, or that concepts may be more difficult to grasp then when what you thought, is an invaluable lesson. In these moments I often had to accept the best thing I could do was take a break, go for a walk, and come back to it later. Certainly had a few slices of humble pie during my time at Flatiron. 

Speaking of humble, I do wish I had come into the program with a little more modesty. I admit that I was rather cocky coming in. I have a degree in STEM from a very well respected university, I have made some pretty complex things with code before, and I pride myself on being an incredibly fast learner. While all these things did give me an edge to get going in the program, they were the sword I fell on when things got hard. These same things that made me feel confident were the same things that made me feel bad when I couldn't get a concept. They made me hesitant to ask for help. The biggest thing I would change coming into the program again, would be to check my ego at the door. 

My single favorite thing I did, and the largest bit of advice I could give to new flatiron students, is simply to code a lot! Do the curriculum, then get ahead on the curriculum, then do some puzzles, then read an article, just keep coding. The moment you get ahead, you gain a great advantage. Flexibility. It allows you to either slow down and soak in something, or it allows you to learn even more! The more you learn, the easier all future coding will be. I cannot express how valuable coding puzzles have proved to be to me. They allow me to think outside the box, and force you to have FUN. I think this is what will make me a great developer, that I am having fun. And you should have fun when coding too! Completing a puzzle, or making a project is exciting, and it changes the process from work to enjoyment. It is easy to do something you enjoy everyday (even if it makes you crazy sometime). 


I am very happy with what I have learned and the connections I have made coming out of flatiron. One of the greatest decisions I have made, and I would do it all over again in a heartbeat.
